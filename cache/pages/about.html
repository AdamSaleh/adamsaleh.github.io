<p>I am Adam Saleh, and this place will host my random notes and ideas,
mostly about various ideas from programing-language theory, because at my real job,
nobody has time to indulge in those.</p>
<p>So expect extended monad tutorials, weird little logic language implementations and the like.
Mostly in Python. Sometimes in Javascript.</p>
<p>You might find here various topics related to software testing as well.</p>
<p>At work, I am QE at RedHat Mobile, working on CI/CD pipelines, dev-ops integrations, and figuring out
if Jenkins is part of the problem, or part of the solution.</p>
