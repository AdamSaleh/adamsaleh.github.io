<p>Originally, I intended to write one giant post about various algebraic
patterns, mostly in python. This was mostly prompted by not-as-successfull presentation I did at my work,
that was about applicative functors. I thought applicative functors are really cool.
Most colleagues thought that my examples in haskell were not comprehensible.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe if I translate this to Python, more people would understand&quot;, I thought to myself.
But as I wrote, the post grew in size and I had to split it into several posts.
So far, I have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/algebraic-patterns-in-python/">Algebraic patterns in Python</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/monoid-pattern-in-python/">Monoid pattern in Python</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/monoid-for-specifying-configuration/">Monoid for specifying configuration</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/functor-pattern-in-python/">Functor pattern in Python</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/applicative-pattern-in-python/">Applicative pattern in Python</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/posts/applicative-pattern-for-reactive-programming/">Applicative pattern for reactive programming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it will include a proper monad tutorial once :-)</p>
