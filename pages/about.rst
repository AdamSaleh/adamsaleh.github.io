About
===================

I am Adam Saleh, and this place will host my random notes and ideas,
mostly about various ideas from programing-language theory, because at my real job,
nobody has time to indulge in those.

So expect extended monad tutorials, weird little logic language implementations and the like.
Mostly in Python. Sometimes in Javascript.

You might find here various topics related to software testing as well.

At work, I am QE at RedHat Mobile, working on CI/CD pipelines, dev-ops integrations, and figuring out 
if Jenkins is part of the problem, or part of the solution.
