So, we actually managed to play Carcasonne a few times with Elen. This is the one game, that actually works best when all three of us
are playing, and among the games we play it probably is the one which Elen understands the least. I usually play with my wife when our daughter is already asleep.
From time to time we want to play even during the day, so we bring her in with "Hey do you want to play with us?". Even though she doesn't understand the scoring system,
she seems to be entertained by building the city scapes and is quite capable of placing the tiles correctly. What she does understand is that whe wants to be getting points,
often asking "Will I be getting points for this?" or "Wow, I will score so many points!".

Main rule change is, that we don't play with the "farmer", meaning, we never put a meeple laying down on a field. This is mostly to speed-up the game,
and to have onle less option to explain. Even then, a game can drag-on for quite a bit, it takes some time until the three of us manage to lay oll the 100+ square pieces to form a map.
This really is the game where Elen indulges us, instead of other way around. Often after few rounds (and making sure that she has "So many points!"), she might run away, 
or start running in circles around the board. Sometimes we play a turn instead of her. Sometimes we shout "Hey, so you want to play or not? You need to choose where this city-tile will be!"
and answer might be "I don't care! Can my duplo tyranosour play with us?"
