So, we actually managed to play Carcasonne a few times with Elen. This is the one game, that actually works best when all three of us
are playing, and among the games we play it probably is the one which Elen understands the least. I usually play with my wife when our daughter is already asleep.
From time to time we want to play even during the day, so we bring her in with "Hey do you want to play with us?". Even though she doesn't understand the scoring system,
she seems to be entertained by building the city scapes and is quite capable of placing the tiles correctly. What she does understand is that whe wants to be getting points,
often asking "Will I be getting points for this?" or "Wow, I will score so many points!".
