    "\n",
    "I like algebras, when they are used in programming. Probably the most well-known is Relational Algebra. The object in Relational Algebra is a *relation*, with operations like *join*, *projection* and *union*. The nice thing about having something that works like an algebra is, that you always work with the same type of object, reusing the box of tools without breaking the flow.\n",
