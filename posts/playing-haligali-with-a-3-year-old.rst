What is Haligali?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is quite an old hame, we used to play from time to time, when visiting my in-laws. One day. we decided to borrow it,
because it seemed that no-one else is playing it, except for times when we visit (and even then Dixit is more popular).
The game itself is based on reflexes and ability to count quickly, similiar to games like set, dobble or jungle-speed.

Rules look like this:
* Everybody starts with a large deck of cards in front of them
* Each card contain one to five pieces of the same fruit (banana, lemon, strawbery or plum)
* there is a small ringing-bell (image) in the reach of every player
* all the players flip the card from their draw decks at once
* if there isn't 5 pieces of the same fruit on the cards together, all players put their card into their personal discard-piles
* if there are 5 pieces of the same fruit total, the player who notices and first rings the bell takes all of the discard piles and shuffles them into her deck
* if the player rings the bell in error, she has to give each other player one card
* last player with cards in the deck wins

Modding the rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have assumed, that quick counting is not one of our Elen's strong suits just yet, even though she manages to count to five.
Therefore we change the relevant rule from "5 pieces of the same fruit together" to "at least two players have same type of fruit".
That s simple enough and there is still some tension with 2 or 3 players.

How does it look like when we are playing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is probably the best suited game/mod that we play together. Trying to hit the bell first is fun, Elen celebrates even when somebody else takes the cards,
and if time my losses correctly, we can play for over 30 minutes. We usually play just in two (because one of us, parents needs to do some things around the household),
but it still is fun when the three of us are together at the table (well, on the carpet, really). Only drawback with playing with 3 is, that with or simplified rules,
the bell gets triggered a bit too often. With more than 3 players we will need to wait for Elen to learn to count to 5 properly.

To conclude,
~~~~~~~~~~~
