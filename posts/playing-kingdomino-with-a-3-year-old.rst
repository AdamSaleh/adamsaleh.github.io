I have recently discovered a really nice boardgame. Well, discovered might be a strong word,
it has won Spiel des Yahres for 2017, so it is pretty well known by now. It is a simple game,
might take me and my wifie around half an hour to play a round and we can manage the rules
even when exhausted after the day is over and before we go to bed.

I think a dedicated review [TODO link] might do a better job of explaining the rules than me,
but for the purposes of this, lets summarize the two-player ruleset:

* you have 24 rectangle tiles, resembling dominoes, split in half to two square regions
* on the back of the tiles you have a number, higher the number implies  more valuable tile
* region might be a field, a pasture, a forest, a lake, a swamp or a gold mine
* in the region, there might be a house, containing 1, 2 or 3 crowns.
* Each player has a square tile with a castle and two king-shaped meeples
* play consists of 6 rounds where each player has two turns to choose new tiles for his kingdom
* before you begin you choose first 4 tiles, sort them from highest to lowest number and then each player alternates and chooses a tile where he puts his king, untill there are 4 kings (of two colors) on 4 tiles
* then round begins, where
  * you draw 4 new tiles and sort them besides the tiles your kings are standing
  * player who has king on the first tile will move him to claim a new tile
  * this player then takes the vacated tile and puts in his kingdom - either besides the castle, or besides a matching tile (dominoes style). All the tiles of your kingdom should fit in 5x5 region.
  * then player with king on the second tile does the same, e.t.c untill there are only 4 newly claimed tiles
  * then next round starts
