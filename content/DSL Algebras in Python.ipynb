    "# What do I mean by DSL Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I say algebra, I don't think about implementing i.e. DSL for linear algebra in Python. I think about algebra in general as in \"a set of objects and a collection of operations on them\".\n",
    "\n",
    "I like algebras, when they are used in programming. Probably the most well-known is Relational Algebra. The object in Relational Algebra is a *relation*, with operations like *join*, *projection* and *union*. The nice thing about having something that works like an algebra is, that you always work with the same type of object, reusing the box of tools without breaking the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember working in a language had good set-algebra, where I solved so many of my problems by generously combining *filter*, *union* and *intersection*. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I have been watching too many talks from Scala conferences and reading too many posts from haskell enthusiasts.\n",
    "And now I envy them. Because I am mostly working with javascript and python and barely anybody even knows what `monad` *is*, while on the scala-side they are using co-free co-monads to implement cool, extensible DSLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, there is fantasy-land and Ramda, but last time my colleague was trying to show off Ramda to the rest of the team, he mostly got puzzled looks from the most of them. And there isn't much in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I still want to try all of those cool things I see in the typed functional languages."
