    "# Applicative Functors?\n",
    "\nApplicative functors are, let me say, a desin pattern, popular in typed functional languages. Mostly Haskell, because of their roots in cateory-theory and that sounds like a thing people writing Haskell like. Based on conference talks Scala people are trying to use this pattern as well. So my question would be, is this still usefull even if I don't have a static type system? "

    "The question then became, how do we keep the awesome things about Haskell, like no Null-pointer exceptions, testable stateless functions, but add new things on top of it. What if it makes sense to have global variable, I/O, or return null? If want to build i.e. a database, all of these look useful. \n",

    "What then happened was that Philip Wadler read a paper about using monads from category theory as interface to chain I/O operations. And he implemented this as the base for I/O in haskell.
