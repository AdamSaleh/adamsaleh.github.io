    "# Applicative Functors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Applicative functors are, let me say, a desin pattern, popular in typed functional languages. Mostly Haskell, because of their roots in cateory-theory and that sounds like a thing people writing Haskell like. Based on conference talks Scala people are trying to use this pattern as well. So my question would be, is this still usefull even if I don't have a static type system? \n",
    "\n",
    "To show this, I first need a reasonably non-contrived function with at least 3 parameters."
