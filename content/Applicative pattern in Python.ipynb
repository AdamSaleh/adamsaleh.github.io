    "Lets look at nesting of two different functors, where we would have T[U[A]]. It is easy to see, that for any a, T[U[a]] is a functor as well.\n",

    "If map for T is tmap, and map for U is umap, we can define the tumap for the nesting of U in T like this:\n",

    "  return tmap(lambda x: umap(f,x), tu)\n",
