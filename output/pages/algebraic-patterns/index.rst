Originally, I intended to write one giant post about various algebraic
patterns, mostly in python. This was mostly prompted by not-as-successfull presentation I did at my work,
that was about applicative functors. I thought applicative functors are really cool.
Most colleagues thought that my examples in haskell were not comprehensible.

"Maybe if I translate this to Python, more people would understand", I thought to myself.
But as I wrote, the post grew in size and I had to split it into several posts.
So far, I have:

* :doc:`algebraic-patterns-in-python`
* :doc:`monoid-pattern-in-python`
* :doc:`monoid-for-specifying-configuration`
* :doc:`functor-pattern-in-python`
* :doc:`applicative-pattern-in-python`
* :doc:`applicative-pattern-for-reactive-programming`

Maybe it will include a proper monad tutorial once :-)
